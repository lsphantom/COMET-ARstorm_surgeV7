A collection of 9 realistic animating fish.

Load "Animating_Fish_AllFish.unity" for an example scene showing all the fish, or "Animating_Fish_Test.unity" for a test environment.

If you wish to use an individual fish to your project, simply drag the required fish from the Prefabs folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window. 

To animate the fish along a path, first drag the prefab "AnimPath_Circle" from the Prefabs folder into the Hierarchy. Then drag your chosen fish on top of this node (making it a child of this parent). If your fish is not facing the direction of travel you may need to rotate it 90 degrees on the Y axis (in the Inspector on the right).

Also available is the Underwater FX pack, a wide range of objects and effects to bring your underwater environment alive: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/61157
